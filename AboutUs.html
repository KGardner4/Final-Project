			Hi I'm Olivia and I would describe my style as down to Earth, humble, 
			sometimes get up throw something on. I'm not much of a girly type; 
			I'm more like a tomboy. So I prefer pants over dresses and skirts, 
			but that's just me. I'm hoping to expand my style and try something new.

			Hi. I'm Kayla and I would describe my style as casual because  
			my wardrobe consists of mostly jeans, leggings, and graphic t-shirts.
			My style is laid-back and super random because the way I dress 
			is dependent on my mood, I'm not an expert in fashion so I don't have a specific brand.

			Hello, my name is Breanna and I'm 13 making this fashion website I am gonna tell you about my style. 
			My style is colorful and  something that matches with what I have on because with the clothes I 
			like to show my personality with the clothes I'm wearing which is not sticking out the crowd 
			basically just chilling and comfort because when I'm doing something or nothing I wanna feel ok with my body.
